# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Exploring Socioeconomic and Environmental Correlations in United States

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. What is the correlation between socioeconomic factors (education, income, employment) and environmental conditions (deforestation, pollution) in US, if any?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The relationship between socioeconomic development and environmental health is essential for sustainable growth. This project aims to explore the correlation between key socioeconomic indicators (education levels, income, employment rates) and environmental conditions (deforestation rates, pollution levels) in the United States. By leveraging comprehensive datasets from reliable sources like the World Bank and Global Forest Watch (GFW), this analysis will provide insights into how economic and social progress interact with environmental sustainability. 
<!-- The project will utilize statistical and machine learning methods to identify patterns and relationships, enabling policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders to make informed decisions for balanced development. The results of this project could inform policy and highlight the areas that need intervention to promote environmental conservation while advancing socioeconomic development. -->
